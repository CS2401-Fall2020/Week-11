# Week 11

Midterm 3 will be on this Monday during the lab session. 

The lab will be related to testing, given a compiled class, you need to write tests to figure out whats wrong. Maybe based on binary search trees. Given a tree class that does something wrong write tests that figure out what it is and what causes it.
